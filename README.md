# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this project

This project was a final project for the 5 months bootcamp formation I followed (wich was my first contact with the web dev sector).
It was developed in under a month ( front and back ) with the purpose of showing what have been learn during the bootcamp.
It is of course not finish, but is still a good display of what I was capable of.

Developed with React.js and Redux.js with a buit-in pseudo router system.

## The idea behind this project

The idea was to create an app that would be destined to companies as a task management tools amongs work teams.
As such, an important part of this app was the admin panel, reserverd to an admin profile, for the creation, edition and supression of users and work groups as well as data gathering (this part is not yet implemented).
The admin would be in charge of reseting the password of a user who would have forgot his with a temporary password.

## Important things

I made sure to make this app responsive so it remains confortable to use on a mobile phone.
There is a home made strong password generator that the admin to create temporary passwords :

## Points of improvement

There is the base of dark theme option prepared, but it need just a little bit of work to make sure everything works well.
The regular user side need a lot of design work and is overall not finish.
On the admin side, what remains to be done is the "get users" section which should be a more general statistic tool in the end. This one is something I might come back to because it could be very interessting and I'm sure there is a lot for me to learn there in data handling and displaying.

### Few words

Bare in mind that this one my very first project. I'm more than happy to receive some feedback on it, what I could have done differently, what is simply bad, what could be improve, and so on.
So don't hesitate to reach out, I would be more than appriciative.
